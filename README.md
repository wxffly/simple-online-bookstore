# Getting Started

### Guides
Note:
* Run the SQL scripts init.sql in the root directory of the project. 
* Remember to change the database configuration information in the application.yml file.


### Bonus Points
* AI-powered recommendation system

To integrate AI-powered recommendation system, we can choose Google Cloud AI's recommendation into the bookstore system, we can follow these high-level steps:

Create a Google Cloud Account: Initially, you'll need to create an account on Google Cloud and complete the registration and authentication processes.

Set Up a Project: Within the Google Cloud console, create a new project that will be used to manage and deploy resources and services related to the recommendation AI.

Configure AI Services: Enable and configure AI services within your project. Google Cloud offers a variety of services and tools, such as Google Cloud AI Platform, Google Cloud AutoML, and others that can be leveraged for building recommendation systems.

Prepare Data: Gather and import relevant datasets, which may include user behavior data, product information, user preferences, and more.

Train the Model: Utilize machine learning tools and algorithms provided by Google Cloud, like TensorFlow, to train your model on the prepared datasets.

Deploy the Model: Once the model is trained, deploy it to Google Cloud's AI services so that it can be utilized through API calls.

Integrate the Application: Integrate the recommendation AI service into your bookstore application. By calling the API interface, you can retrieve personalized recommendations and display them to users.

Test and Optimize: Before going live, thoroughly test the system to ensure the accuracy and performance of the recommendation features. Continuously optimize the recommendation algorithm based on user feedback and system performance data.

Deploy and Monitor: Deploy the bookstore system with the integrated AI recommendation service to the production environment and monitor its performance to ensure the responsiveness and accuracy of the recommendation service.

* Design an anomaly detection system for identifying potential fraudulent orders

To design an anomaly detection system for identifying potential fraudulent orders in an online bookstore system, you can leverage Google Cloud AI's capabilities, which offer powerful machine learning tools for analyzing transactions and detecting anomaliesã€‚ Here's a high-level overview of how to integrate Google Cloud AI's recommendation system into the bookstore system:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather order data, including transaction amounts, payment methods, user behavior, and any other relevant information that could indicate fraudulent activity.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Use Google Cloud's BigQuery to create new features from the raw order data. This could involve calculating the frequency of orders, the average transaction value, or identifying sudden spikes in activity that deviate from normal patterns.

3. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using BigQuery ML or AI Platform Notebooks. You can start with supervised learning models if you have labeled data indicating past fraudulent transactions. If labeled data is scarce, unsupervised learning models can be used to detect anomalies based on deviations from the norm.

4. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to Google Cloud for real-time analysis of new orders. The model will process incoming transaction data and score each order based on the likelihood of it being fraudulent.

5. **Integration**: Integrate the Google Cloud AI model with the bookstore's order processing system. This can be done through APIs that send order data to the AI model and receive fraud scores in return.

6. **Alert System**: Implement an alert system within the bookstore system that triggers when the AI model identifies an order with a high fraud score. This could involve notifying administrators or automatically holding the order for further review.

7. **Monitoring and Optimization**: Continuously monitor the performance of the anomaly detection system and optimize the model as needed. Use feedback loops where administrators can confirm or refute the fraud predictions, providing new data to refine the model.

8. **Compliance and Ethics**: Ensure that the anomaly detection system complies with data protection regulations and ethical standards, safeguarding user privacy and ensuring fair practices.

By following these steps and utilizing Google Cloud AI's capabilities, you can effectively enhance the bookstore system with an anomaly detection system that helps to identify and prevent fraudulent orders.
